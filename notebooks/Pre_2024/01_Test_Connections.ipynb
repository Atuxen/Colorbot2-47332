    "did most of the design for us, although we had to modify and improve it in several ways. \n",
    "One major change we made to the robot is that we changed the operating system to a \n",
    "[Debian Linux-based system](https://www.ev3dev.org/). \n",
    "This allows us to use the programming language of our choice (Python, naturally) with all its flexibility and available modules.\n",
    "We thus have relatively easy access to state-of-the-art data science and machine learning software modules and could, in \n",
    "principle, run everyting directly on the LEGO EV3 brick computer. In practice the LEGO computer is rather slow once you begin \n",
    "doing semi-demanding operations such as training machine learning models, and we will thus run our main calculations on the \n",

    "into the model on purpose), and is significantly faster than the physical robot.\n",
    "The *in silico* model is not written in the most computationally efficient way but instead such that you can easily switch \n",
    "between the *in silico* color mixer and the robot color mixer software. We will be using the *in silico* color mixer in the \n",
