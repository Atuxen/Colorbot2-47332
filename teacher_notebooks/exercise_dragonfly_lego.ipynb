    "Hi there! As you are getting better at python and are building yourselves a toolbox, these notebooks will become thinner, provide less code, and require more of you. You will get far by using your old notebooks and copy/paste cells from those into this. This is in particular true today whre you will combine the first lego robot exercise and the *in silico* robot exercise with Dragonfly.\n",

It might seem like we are spending resources without any gain during the exploration function calls of the optimization, but as you will see one of these next days where you will compare standard optimizers and the Bayesian, it can make a world of difference."
