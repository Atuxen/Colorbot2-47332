    "# Color mixing as a test system\n",
    "In the course you will do recurrent exercises focused on mixing target colors. In practice we do this by mixing food colors diluted in water. Although we do perform significantly more complicated autonoums experiments in our daily research, mixing colored liquids is significantly closer to state-of-the-art for demonstration of autonomous orchestration than you might expect, as seen in [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229862), which can also be found in the course group on DTU Inside. Sadly, we will not be doing the Tequilla Sunrise mixing also performed in that paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give each group access to their very own robot, which can be operated without specialist knowledge and safety measures, we went with LEGO. Luckily, [someone](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001413) already did most of the design for us, although we did have to modify and improve it in several ways. One major change we made to the robot is that we changed the operating system to a [Debian Linux-based system](https://www.ev3dev.org/). This allows us to use the programming language of our choice (Python, naturally) with all its flexibility and available modules. We thus have relatively easy access to state-of-the-art data science and machine learning software modules and could, in principle, run everyting directly on the LEGO EV3 brick computer. In practice the LEGO computer is rather slow once you begin doing semi-demanding operations such as training machine learning models, and we will thus run our main calculations on the gbar and send simple commands to the robot, which will execute them and pass back the result. More on that later in this notebook and later during the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also written an *in silico*, i.e. a purely software, surrogate model for the color mixing robot, SilicoColorMixer. It has the advantage that it requires less maintenance, is less prone to error and data noise (beyond the noise introduced into the model on purpose), and is significantly faster than the physical robot. The *in silico* model is not written in the most computationally efficient way but instead such that you can easily switch between the *in silico* color mixer and the robot color mixer software. We will be using the *in silico* color mixer in the course to test various algorithms etc. before applying the code to the physical robot."
